# Shorter-Links

This script will send a POST request to the https://api.example.com/shorten endpoint with the long URL that you want to shorten, and then return the shortened URL. You will need to replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key, and modify the endpoint and request parameters to fit the specific API of the link shortening service that you are using.
